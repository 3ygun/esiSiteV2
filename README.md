# The eSports Initiative Site Redesign

## The Project:
Remake the before 2015 Rails site (https://github.com/mcrazy20/ESITestWebsite) to improve:
- Edit-ability
- Scalability
- General Design Appearance

## The Team:
- David Soller >> 3ygun
- Others Please!

## How to get involved:
There are three main areas of the site that need help:
- Content Creation (Are you the next best thing to Edgar Allen Poe? If the answer is yes OR no then you can write those pesky paragraphs that the site needs to showcase information. Proceed to "Content" below)
- Design (I have realized I'm atrocious at it & have decided to never pursue front end development please help. If you would like to provide design help please see "Design" below)
- Development (This is the coding stuff. What I'm kind of good at/want to do. Proceed to how to help with "Development" below)

## How do I contribute as an involved individual:
### First, Determine what needs to be done:
Either:
- Proceed to the Issues section on the right to see what needs to be created, edited, updated, etc.
- Or download/clone the code and find issues and fix them

### Second, Found an Issue I want to fix now what:
- For a Design or Content issue:
	- Post the solution under the respective issue for my to look at/add to the code
	- Message me on Facebook with your solution/idea
	- Email me the solution: soller.23@osu.edu
- For a Development issue:
	- ^^ Any of the above are acceptable ^^. However, creating a pull request on the repository is better as I can directly add your code to the project easily.
	- If you need help just ask Google or Bing for help like most developers do <3.

## Content:
There are a number of ways to help that do and don't involve coding in HTML5/CSS3. Most obvious of these is content generation. There is a very good reason I don't enjoy English and if you like to write small paragraphs talking up ESI then go for it! Look in the issues section along the left side to see what paragraphs need to be written/edited (HINT: all the Latin stuff in the code). 

### FAQ
- Wait why is there Latin in the code where pristine sentences are supposed to go?
	- Basically its a space holder that is obvious if it's not corrected!

## Design:
If you know it, you can probably see I don't got it. Either way if you have design suggestions/improvements please follow the the "How do I contribute as an involved individual" steps. Either post a description of you purposed design change/update or (Preferably) sketch out/color the idea & send me the document/picture of the change. The latter allows me to directly translate your design into the code. Disclaimer regarding design: As you know design isn't a science therefore we are entitled to our ideas of good and/or bad. Therefore all ideas/suggestions may or may not be implemented.  


## Development:
This punk David has taken to long and now I want his job. No, please by all means take it! Just clone the project via the link at the left side and develop a bit of it yourself. For references Google and Bing are you best resources.
